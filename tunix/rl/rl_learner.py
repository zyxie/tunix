    This method is designed to efficiently process data in micro-batches while
    accommodating the requirements of different model computations (e.g.
    rollout, ref_logps, old_logps, training) that may have different optimal
    batch sizes.

    The pipeline follows these main steps:
    1. **Merge**: It consumes multiple small micro-batches from the input
       `iterator` and merges them into a single, larger batch. This is done to
       meet the `service_target_bs`, which is the least common multiple of the
       micro-batch sizes for different services, ensuring efficient hardware
       utilization.
    2. **Repeat (Sample)**: Each prompt in the merged batch is repeated
       `sample_repeat` times based on the algorithm needs(e.g. G in GRPO).
       For algorithmrs that don't repeat prompts, this will be 1 (e.g. PPO).
    3. **Single Large Forward Pass**: The resulting large batch of repeated
       prompts is then processed in a single call to
       `_generate_and_compute_advantage`. This function handles text generation,
       reward computation, and advantage calculation for the entire batch.
    4. **Split**: After processing, the large `TrainExample` is split back into
       smaller chunks that correspond to the original input micro-batches.
    5. **Enqueue**: These smaller `TrainExample` chunks are then put into the
       `data_queue` to be consumed by the training loop.

    Args:
      iterator: An iterator yielding `TrainingInputT` examples.
      proceed_num_steps: The number of training micro-batches to process before
        returning. If > 0, the function will stop after consuming this many
        steps. If -1, it will continue until the iterator is exhausted.
      sample_repeat: The number of times each sample in a micro-batch is
        repeated during the advantage computation. This is typically
        `grpo_config.num_generations`.
      batch_repeat: The number of times the produced `TrainExample` batch should
        `grpo_config.num_iterations`.
      service_target_batch_size: largest common multiple of rollout and
        compute_logps micro-batch sizes. This is used to accumulate
        micro-batches between the rollout and inference computation.
      data_queue: The queue to which lists of `TrainExample` are added.
      async_loading: If True, enqueue each produced micro-batch immediately in
        async mode. Otherwise, accumulate and enqueue at the boundary.
      mode: The metrics logger mode, either `metrics_logger.Mode.TRAIN` or
        `metrics_logger.Mode.EVAL`.
